# Task Management System

## Overview

This is a simple task management system (todo list) implemented in TypeScript. It consists of a `Task` model and a `TaskManager` service that allows for adding, removing, finding, filtering, and sorting tasks.

## Features

- Create, update, and remove tasks
- Filter tasks by completion status
- Sort tasks by title
- Unit tests for key functionalities

## Architecture

The system is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and follows SOLID design principles to ensure maintainability and scalability.

### Components

- **Task**: Represents a task with properties such as `id`, `title`, `description`, and `completed` status.
- **TaskManager**: Manages a collection of tasks and provides methods for task manipulation.
